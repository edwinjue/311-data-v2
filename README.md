# 311-Data v2
## "Democratizing public data to improve community initiatives"

We are a group of volunteers with diverse backgrounds who share a common vision: To make Los Angeles service request data more accessible and useful for our diverse  communities and their representatives. 

By leveraging technology, we can empower local residents and [Neighborhood Councils](https://empowerla.org/councils/) to 
* Access
* Analyze
* Visualize 

the service requests submitted through Los Angeles's 311 system at https://myla311.lacity.org/. 

Our application is open source, built and maintaned by volunteers throughout our community and provides two primary modes of operation:
* An interactive map showing where different types of 311 requests are being submitted
* Dashboards that show what types of requests are being made, how quickly they're being resolved, how different councils compare, and more

Our mission is to create a user-friendly platform for anyone interested in exploring 311 service requests so that they can immediately gain actionable insights. Our project is called 311-Data v2, and we are looking for sponsors who can support our efforts and help us scale our impact. 

If you are interested in learning more about our project, would like to volunteer or become a sponsor, please
